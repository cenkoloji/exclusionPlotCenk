- Start profile is already P_CB,
Send code to theo


- the pressure and density units are a total mess and a lot of conversion is done in the code. Make all function arguments and outputs same unit(mbar, g/cm3)




=============================

+  Understand the drops in nSigmas in negative values.
    Example: 0.645: max is almost 0, 0.650: max is 50 sigmas less than 0
    Observation: nsigmas are high in negative direction, for pressures with less exposure time

+  Check line 6623 in 2008tckInfoSunset3_OUT.txt
   138867  265     385     3308140802      149.999 -3.2335 1.83736 35.42222        0.72389
   *** Time exposure is 149.999, its ok

+ Seperate detector 2 and 3
+ Create files with different low and high energy efficiencies as a linear function(using 6 and 3 keV eff)
+ Define good environment variables to define output and input paths
+ Make program based on testLike.cxx and put in ./bin
+ In castGas, there is type=3. Remove if not needed
+ Correct Magnet Length formulas (castGas::getMagnetLength)
+ Check Pressure formulas (castGas::)
