After implementation of castProfile and castConfig

- Make conversionStudy
- Add members to the castTracking class such as bckLevel and expCounts. Otherwise these are calculated at every iteration calculating the exclusion plot. Its stupid



=============================

+  Understand the drops in nSigmas in negative values.
    Example: 0.645: max is almost 0, 0.650: max is 50 sigmas less than 0
    Observation: nsigmas are high in negative direction, for pressures with less exposure time

+  Check line 6623 in 2008tckInfoSunset3_OUT.txt
   138867  265     385     3308140802      149.999 -3.2335 1.83736 35.42222        0.72389
   *** Time exposure is 149.999, its ok

+ Seperate detector 2 and 3
+ Create files with different low and high energy efficiencies as a linear function(using 6 and 3 keV eff)
+ Define good environment variables to define output and input paths
+ Make program based on testLike.cxx and put in ./bin
+ In castGas, there is type=3. Remove if not needed
+ Correct Magnet Length formulas (castGas::getMagnetLength)
+ Check Pressure formulas (castGas::)


If needed: Theo code:

IGNORE BELOW
- Add angle if needed to all lines, that has flag ***ANGLE??? It's not baked enough
    * If you'll add it best seems as recreating exposure file with 1 min bins, without doing fancy exposure calculation. And creating files as:
    Pressure    Angle   ExpTime(fixed:60 sec)



List of angle dependency:
castConversion:
    - CalculateNormalizedFactor
        *castGas->GetMagnetLength
    - ConversionProbability
        *castGas->getPhotonMass
        *CalculateNormalizedFactor
        *AbsorptionCoeff
        *castGas->getMagnetLength
Ok there is a lot I can't track all here
