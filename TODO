- Seperate detector 2 and 3
+ Create files with different low and high energy efficiencies as a linear function(using 6 and 3 keV eff)
+ Define good environment variables to define output and input paths
+ Make program based on testLike.cxx and put in ./bin
+ In castGas, there is type=3. Remove if not needed
+ Correct Magnet Length formulas (castGas::getMagnetLength)
+ Check Pressure formulas (castGas::)


If needed: Theo code:
/afs/cern.ch/exp/cast/mmM11/wdirsr2010/Analysis2010/Exclusion


- Use new input files with density calculated by Theo


IGNORE BELOW
- Add angle if needed to all lines, that has flag ***ANGLE??? It's not baked enough
    * If you'll add it best seems as recreating exposure file with 1 min bins, without doing fancy exposure calculation. And creating files as:
    Pressure    Angle   ExpTime(fixed:60 sec)



List of angle dependency:
castConversion:
    - CalculateNormalizedFactor
        *castGas->GetMagnetLength
    - ConversionProbability
        *castGas->getPhotonMass
        *CalculateNormalizedFactor
        *AbsorptionCoeff
        *castGas->getMagnetLength
Ok there is a lot I can't track all here
