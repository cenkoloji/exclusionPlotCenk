- Add angle if needed to all lines, that has flag ***ANGLE??? It's not baked enough
    * If you'll add it best seems as recreating exposure file with 1 min bins, without doing fancy exposure calculation. And creating files as:
    Pressure    Angle   ExpTime(fixed:60 sec)

- Define good environment variables to define output and input paths
- Make program based on testLike.cxx and put in ./bin
- Program to calculate ngamma
- In the end rename getMagnetLength as getCoherenceLength
+ Implement different low and high energy efficiencies in castDetector
+ In castGas, there is type=3. Remove if not needed
+ Correct Magnet Length formulas (castGas::getMagnetLength)
+ Check Pressure formulas (castGas::)

If needed: Theo code:

List of angle dependency:
castConversion:
    - CalculateNormalizedFactor
        *castGas->GetMagnetLength
    - ConversionProbability
        *castGas->getPhotonMass
        *CalculateNormalizedFactor
        *AbsorptionCoeff
        *castGas->getMagnetLength

Or: Tracing back from testLike:
