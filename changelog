	* calculating castTracking members only once
	* Only implemented in getGL4.
	* Next step to implement everywhere(plotGL4, GetMax)

22-11-2013 Cenk Yildiz <cenk.yildiz@cern.ch>
	* Wrote method in castLike to calculate members of castTracking, so
	that they will be calculated only once.

	* Added simulation code, creates exposure and tracking counts file

11-11-2013 Cenk Yildiz <cenk.yildiz@cern.ch>
	* many changes, castConfig and castProfile classes added
	* Next change is totally removing the ConversionProbabilityFromLength
	and ConversionProbabilityFromProfile functions, and merging them in
	ConversionProbability function

	* Cleaned all methods in castExposure. Pushing the new commit
	* This version still uses Trees, will be replaced with vector in new version

	* Some time ago, all classes were cleaned
	* Removed ROOT stuff, now reading exposure and counts via vectors
	* Made a nice clean makefile
	* sample program is in src/testLike.cxx
