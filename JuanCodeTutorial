Initialize trees:
trkTree
expTree

Fills trees with content of output files (exposure and tracking counts)
I believe its not necessary, creating arrays should be enough.
However there is something nice about writing and reading a tree from a class, it reads in the order of data members. I can keep it.

gL4=like->GetgL4(ma,expTree,tckTree);

    nGamma = GetNgammaCounts(ma,expTree): It gets total expected photons for all exposure, for this axion mass, as a function of g
